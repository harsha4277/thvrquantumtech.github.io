                                        <p>We understand that design elements are a matter of personal taste, and what works for one person/demographics, might not work for another. This is why, we collect all the information from you that we can, during the design process itself, including your preferences/views. We combine that with the practicality and business goals to come up with the design. 
                                            <br>
                                        In case you do not like the initial design, we ask you for your feedback on why you do not like the design, to understand our mistake and correct it.
                                        <br>
                                        We offer up to three revisions/ideas of design for the website, but usually most of our clients do not require more than one major design change before we 'get it right'.

                                        <p>Yes. One of the major features of the solutions that we provide is scalability and adaptability. We understand that everybody wants their business to grow, and in order to grow one must respond to the volatile market trends and changing requirements, and you would want your site/application to assist in your growth, rather than be a hindrance. Hence, we always take care to make a solution that can be scaled and adapted according to how your business shapes itself over time.

                                            <li>Sprints are development iterations which are short (usually one to two weeks in length), and produce a deliverable implementation of a software feature which can be tested and collected feedback on.</li>
                                            <li>Sprints allow us to give you many quick and small deliveries -- rather than one large and lengthy delivery -- related to your project</li>
                                            <li>We encourage feedback collection from early stages of development, so that the solutions can be adjusted quickly, rather than spending a huge amount of time trying to document a feature to the minutest detail</li>
